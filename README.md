# NLP-codes

This folder contains several tasks of Natural language processing using python. The tasks are:
1. Text normalization using Stemming, lemmatizing using NLTK (Natural Languge Toolkit) library
2. Finding similarity between 2 strings using Levenshtein Distance and cosine distance.
3. Topic modeling using algorithms LSI ( Latent Semantic Indexing) and LDA ( Latent Dirichlet Allocation), from gensim library.
4. Document classification using Machine Learning algorithms like SVM (Support Vector Machines), Naive Bayes,using sklearn library.
5. Finding semantic similarity between query and the documents in the data,by calculating Word Movers Distance (WMD) using Gensim, from GoogleNews pre-trained word2vec model.
