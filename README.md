# NLP-codes

This folder contains python codes for performing tasks of Natural language processing. The tasks are:
1. Text normalization using Stemming, lemmatizing using NLTK library.
2. Finding similarity between 2 strings using Levenshtein Distance and cosine distance.
3. Calculating TF-IDF scores on the documents using sklearn library.
3. Topic modeling using algorithms LSI ( Latent Semantic Indexing) and LDA ( Latent Dirichlet Allocation), using gensim library.
4. Document classification using Machine Learning algorithms: SVM (Support Vector Machines), Naive Bayes, random forest, logistic regression, using sklearn library.
5. Finding semantic similarity for query from the documents in the data,by calculating Word Movers Distance (WMD) similarity using Gensim, using GoogleNews pre-trained word2vec model.
6. Sentiment Analysis using Linear SVM classifier on Amazon customer reviews dataset.
