# NLP-codes

This folder contains several tasks of Natural language processing using python. The tasks such as:
1. Text normalization using Stemming, lemmatizing using NLTK (Natural Languge Toolkit) library
2. Finding similarity between 2 strings using Levenshtein Distance and cosine distance.
3. Topic modeling using algorithms LSI ( Latent Semantic Indexing) and LDA ( Latent Dirichlet Allocation), from gensim library.
4. Document classification using Machine Learning algorithms like : 
   SVM (Support Vector Machines)
   Naive Bayes,
   
   using sklearn library.
