This directory contains the ready to use python script with the implementation of machine learning algorithm SVM, for the purpose of binary classification.

This is used in the Resume Extraction project, for filtering out the resumes based on the job description. Here we were supposed to extract the candidates name, location, DOB, educational qualification, internships, total working experience, skills, organization names candidate is worked in. 

Here the problem was we needed to calculate candidates working experience excluding the internships. But as the internship descriptions also contains the organization names and dates, we were not able to distinguish the experience from interships.

So this classifier solves the above problem and classifies the given sentence / text into one of the two classes ( Experience/ Internship )
