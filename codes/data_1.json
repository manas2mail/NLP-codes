This is permitted on the condition that all the procedures and rules set out in this policy are complied with. Be aware, however, that if you choose to make use of our facilities for personal correspondence, you can expect very little privacy because Edelweiss may need to monitor communications. \nUnder no circumstances may Edelweiss facilities be used in connection with the operation or management of any business other than that of Edelweiss or a customer/client of Edelweiss unless express permission has been obtained from your LoB head. \nAll personal email you send from Edelweiss facilities must be marked PERSONAL in the subject heading, and all personal email sent or received must be filed in a separate folder marked \"Personal\" in your inbox should you wish to retain it after reading. Contact IT Support if you need guidance on how to set up and use a personal folder. All email contained in your inbox and your sent items box are deemed to be business communications for the purposes of monitoring. \nYou must ensure that your personal email use: \ndoes not interfere with the performance of your duties; \ndoes not take priority over your work responsibilities; \nis minimal and limited to taking place substantially outside of normal working hours (i.e. during any breaks which you are entitled to or before or after your normal hours of work); \ndoes not cause unwarranted expense or liability to be incurred by Edelweiss; \ndoes not have a negative impact on Edelweiss in any way; and \nis lawful and complies with this policy. \nAs with any correspondence made using Edelweiss electronic facilities, you can delete personal email from the live system, but they will have been copied (perhaps many times) onto the backup tapes and in that form will be retained indefinitely. It would be a very difficult, costly and time-consuming exercise to sift all those tapes in order to delete an individual's personal email, and if we were to agree to attempt this, it would be at our convenience, and only on the basis that all the very considerable costs involved were paid in advance by the person making the request. \nBy making personal use of our facilities for sending and receiving email you signify your agreement to abide by the conditions imposed for their use, and signify your consent to Edelweiss monitoring your personal email in accordance with item 9 of this policy.",

Edelweiss may monitor your business communications for reasons which include: \nproviding evidence of business transactions; \nensuring that Edelweiss business procedures, policies and contracts with staff are adhered to; \ncomplying with any legal obligations; \nmonitoring standards of service, staff performance, and for staff training; \npreventing or detecting unauthorised use of Edelweiss communications systems or \ncriminal activities; and \nmaintaining the effective operation of Edelweiss communications systems. \nEdelweiss will monitor telephone, email and internet traffic data (i.e. sender, receiver, subject; non-business attachments to email, numbers called and duration of calls; domain names of websites visited, duration of visits, and files downloaded from the internet) at a network level (but covering both personal and business communications) for the purposes specified in above item. For the purposes of your maintenance of your own personal privacy, you need to be aware that such monitoring might reveal sensitive personal data about you. By carrying out such activities using Edelweiss facilities you consent to our processing any sensitive personal data about you, which may be revealed by such monitoring. \nSometimes it is necessary for Edelweiss to access your business communications during your absence, such as when you are away because you are ill or while you are on holiday. Unless your mailbox settings are such that the individuals who need to do this already have permission to view your inbox, access will be granted only with the permission of one of the persons authorised to grant such access. \nAny emails which are not stored in your \"Personal\" folder in your mailbox and which are not marked PERSONAL in the subject heading will be treated, for the purpose of availability for monitoring, as business communications since we will have no way of knowing that they were intended to be personal. Therefore, you must set up a rule to automate the routing of personal email to your personal folder - ask IT Support for guidance on how to do this. Furthermore, there is a risk that any person authorised to access your mailbox may have their own preview pane option as a default setting, which would reveal the content of any of your personal email not filed in your \"Personal\" folder, whether or not such email are marked PERSONAL. It is up to you to prevent the inadvertent disclosure of the content of personal email by filing your personal email in accordance with this policy. In particular, you are responsible to anybody outside Edelweiss who sends to you, or receives from you, a personal email, for the consequences of any breach of their privacy which may be caused by your failure to file your personal email. \nIn certain very limited circumstances we may, subject to compliance with any legal requirements, access email marked PERSONAL. Examples are when we have reasonable suspicion that they may reveal evidence of unlawful activity, including instances where there may be a breach of a contract with Edelweiss. \nAll incoming email are scanned by IT on behalf of Edelweiss, using virus-checking software. The software will also block unsolicited marketing email (spam) and email which have potentially inappropriate attachments. If there is a suspected virus in an email, the same will automatically be deleted.",

That means if Basic salary at the time of retirement was Rs.40,000/- then 15 days\u2019 salary would come to Rs.23,077/- = (40,000 * 15 / 26).\n Let\u2019s understand the above math clearly with an example:Mr. X is has retired with effect from 15 th April, 2014 and he had completed 10 years 6 months and 10 days till his retirement date. His Basic salary on retirement was Rs.40,000/- pm which has been same for last 1 year.Hence, Gratuity amount payable to Mr. X would be Rs.2,53,846 = (40,000 * 15 / 26 * 11 years)",

The responsibility to learn and develop is a triangular responsibility and the fulcrum of the same lies on intent of the three key elements which is the Learner (the employee), the Manager and the HR department. \nThe Role of LandD (HR) is to ensure that learning opportunity is created which is aligned to individuals learning and development needs and is knitted well into the overall business strategy. The Managers role or the Reporting authority\u2019s role is to help identify the learning needs of employees. The employee has to ensure that there is attendance in the program so created for his/her development needs in addition to their role to give candid feedback on the relevance of the course to them. \nOver the years keeping this in mind the company has endeavored to foster a learning and development culture within the group by creating opportunities to undergo facilitator lead classroom training, self paced learning avenue through the ELMS platform, Kwench \u2013 our very own online Library, Learning Nuggets-Business Book summaries, LEAP- The Edelweiss Learning and Education Assistance Program.\n",

There are a few things employees can do to help translate the policy into day-to-day practices.\n 1. Sexual harassment can take many forms: spoken, unspoken or physical. Recognize that you may be conditioned to accept behaviors that infringe on your rights and constitute discriminate or gender discrimination as normal workplace conduct.\n 2. Firmly say NO. It is possible that the offender does not know that their behavior is unacceptable. Promptly make a direct statement and communicate that the offender\u2019s conduct is not acceptable.\n 3.  Participating in jokes and sexually tinged conversation is often taken as tacit permission to continue. Communicate early on that this conduct is unacceptable. Warn the offender to immediately desist, first orally and then if necessary, follow it up with a warning in writing.\n 4. If employees are unsure of the course of action to take in a given situation, they should approach any of the Committee members informally and take their counsel.\n 5. Employees are also encouraged to discuss any issues they may have in this area to their Supervisor / HR representative / any member of the \u2018Internal Complaints Committee\u2019.\n 6. If employees believe that they have been a victim of harassment, or know of another employee who has been, report it immediately. Employees can raise concerns and make reports without fear of reprisal.\n 7. Retaliation against an individual for bringing or corroborating harassment or discrimination allegations is strictly prohibited, so long as such allegations or corroboration are made in good faith and are not knowingly false.",
